  abstract = {Drug delivery to the posterior eye segment is an important challenge in ophthalmology, because many diseases affect the retina and choroid leading to impaired vision or blindness. Currently, intravitreal injections are the method of choice to administer drugs to the retina, but this approach is applicable only in selected cases (e.g. anti-VEGF antibodies and soluble receptors). There are two basic approaches that can be adopted to improve retinal drug delivery: prolonged and/or retina targeted delivery of intravitreal drugs and use of other routes of drug administration, such as periocular, suprachoroidal, sub-retinal, systemic, or topical. Properties of the administration route, drug and delivery system determine the efficacy and safety of these approaches. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors determine the required dosing rates and doses that are needed for drug action. In addition, tolerability factors limit the use of many materials in ocular drug delivery. This review article provides a critical discussion of retinal drug delivery, particularly from the pharmacokinetic point of view. This article does not include an extensive review of drug delivery technologies, because they have already been reviewed several times recently. Instead, we aim to provide a systematic and quantitative view on the pharmacokinetic factors in drug delivery to the posterior eye segment.

Moreover, the factors that can influence the vitreous pharmacokinetics of these drugs, as well as the methods that were used in the studies for analytical determination, have been exposed. These anti-VEGF drugs present different charge and molecular weights, which play an important role in vitreous distribution and elimination. The pharmacokinetic parameters that were collected differ depending on the species that were involved in the studies and on physiological and pathological conditions, such as vitrectomy and lensectomy.

  abstract  = {Background For treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), multiple intravitreal injections of drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) result in a high burden for patients and healthcare systems. Low-energy stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) might reduce the anti-VEGF need. This study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of adjunct SRT to anti-VEGF injections in a treat-and-extend regimen in nAMD.
Methods 50 consecutive patients were followed 3 years after single-session SRT, a safety analysis including standardised study imaging, and a reading centre based image analysis was performed after 2 years.
Results After increase from baseline (4.24±0.66 weeks) to 12 months (7.52±3.05 weeks, p{\textless}0.001), mean recurrence-free anti-VEGF treatment interval remained stable at 24 (7.40±3.17, p=0.746) and 36 months (6.89±3.00, p=0.175). Mean visual acuity change was −5.8±15.9 and −11.0±20.1 letters at 24 and 36 months, respectively. 36\% of eyes showed microvascular abnormalities (MVAs) on colour fundus photography and/or fluoresceine angiography most frequently located in parafoveal inferior and nasal regions.
Conclusion In real life, low-energy SRT was associated with a reduced anti-VEGF injection frequency through year 3. However, due to an observed visual acuity reduction and remarkable number of MVAs, a close follow-up of these patients is recommended. The real-life use, optimal treatment schedule and dose should be rediscussed critically.},

  abstract = {Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibodies or antibody fragments has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The ocular half-life (t1/2) of these large molecules, determined in ocular fluids or derived from serum levels, varies with molecular size and is larger in humans than in preclinical animal species. The high affinity binding of VEGF to these molecules lowers the free concentration of VEGF and reduces its occupancy on VEGF receptors in ocular tissues. To understand the biophysical determinants of t1/2 for anti-VEGF antibodies and the time-course of VEGF in ocular fluids, we developed a mechanistic model of intravitreal pharmacokinetics (IVT PK) for anti-VEGF antibodies and combined it with a mechanistic model of the pharmacodynamics (RVR PD) of VEGF suppression by ranibizumab, an anti-VEGF recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab). Our IVT PK model predicts that the ocular t1/2 of a large molecule will be approximately four-times the calculated value of its vitreous diffusion time (Tdiff), defined as rvit2/6D, where rvit is the radius of the vitreous chamber in that species (modeled as a sphere), and D is the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in physiological saline at 37 °C obtained from the Stokes–Einstein relation. This prediction is verified from a compilation of data and calculations on various large molecules in the human, monkey, rabbit, and rat and is consistent with the reported t1/2 values of ranibizumab in humans (mean value 7.9 days) and the calculated Tdiff of 1.59 days. Our RVR PD model is based on the publication of Saunders et al. (Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2015, 99, 1554−1559) who reported data on the time-course of VEGF levels in aqueous humor samples obtained from 31 patients receiving ranibizumab treatment for wet AMD and developed a compartmental mathematical model to describe the VEGF suppression profiles. We modified Saunders’ model with the known 2:1 stoichiometry of ranibizumab-VEGF binding and included the association and dissociation kinetics of the binding reactions. Using the RVR PD model, we reanalyzed Saunders’ data to estimate the in vivo dissociation constant (KD) between ranibizumab and VEGF. Our analysis demonstrates the delicate interrelationship between the in vivo KD value and the intravitreal half-life and yields an in vivo KD estimate that is appreciably larger than the in vitro KD estimates reported in the literature. Potential explanations for the difference between the in vivo and in vitro KD values, which appear to reflect the different methodologies and experimental conditions, are discussed. We conclude that the combined mechanistic model of IVT PK and RVR PD provides a useful framework for simulating the effects of dose, KD, and the molecular weight of VEGF-binding molecules on the duration of VEGF suppression.},

  abstract   = {Intravitreally (IVT) injected macromolecules for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration must permeate through the inner limiting membrane (ILM) into the retina and through the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to enter the choroid. A quantitative understanding of intraocular transport mechanisms, elimination pathways, and the effect of molecular size is currently incomplete. We present a semimechanistic, 3-compartment (retina, vitreous, and aqueous) pharmacokinetic (PK) model, expressed using linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to describe the molecular concentrations following a single IVT injection. The model was fit to experimental rabbit data, with Fab, Fc, IgG, and IgG null antibodies and antibody fragments, to estimate key ocular pharmacokinetic parameters. The model predicts an ocular half-life, t1/2, which is the same for all compartments and dependent on the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of the respective molecules, consistent with observations from the experimental data. Estimates of the permeabilities of the RPE and ILM are derived for Rh values ranging from 2.5 to 4.9 nm, and are found to be in good agreement with ex-vivo measurements from bovine eyes. We show that the ratio of these permeabilities largely determines the ratio of the molecular concentrations in the retina and vitreal compartments and their dependence on Rh. The model further provides estimates for the ratio of fluxes corresponding to the elimination pathways from the eye, i.e., aqueous humor to retina/choroid, which increase from 5:1 to 7:1 as Rh decreases. Our semimechanistic model provides a quantitative framework for interpreting ocular PK and the effects of molecule size on rate-determining parameters. We have shown that intraocular permeabilities can be reasonably estimated from 3-compartment ocular PK data and can determine how these parameters influence the half-life, retinal permeation, and elimination of intravitreally injected molecules from the eye.},

  abstract = {Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) results from the pathological angiogenesis of choroidal capillaries, which leak ﬂuid within or below the macular region of the retina. The current standard of care for treating wet AMD utilizes intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies or antibody fragments to suppress ocular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. While VEGF suppression has been demonstrated in wet AMD patients by serial measurements of free-VEGF concentrations in aqueous humor samples, it is presumed that anti-VEGF molecules also permeate across the inner limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina as well as the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and suppress VEGF levels in the retina and/or choroidal regions. The latter eﬀects are inferred from serial optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of ﬂuid in the retinal and sub-retinal spaces. In order to gain theoretical insights to the dynamics of retinal levels of free-VEGF following intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF molecules, we have extended our previous two-compartment pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of ranibizumab−VEGF suppression in vitreous and aqueous humors to a three-compartment model that includes the retinal compartment. In the new model, reference values for the macromolecular permeability coeﬃcients between retina and vitreous (pILM) and between retina and choroid (pRPE) were estimated from PK data obtained in rabbit. With these values, the three-compartment model was used to re-analyze the aqueous humor levels of free-VEGF obtained in wet AMD patients treated with ranibizumab and to compare them to the simulated retinal levels of free-VEGF, including the observed variability in PK and PD. We have also used the model to explore the impact of varying pILM and pRPE to assess the case in which an anti-VEGF molecule is impermeable to the ILM and to assess the potential eﬀects of AMD pathology on the RPE barrier. Our simulations show that, for the reference values of pILM and pRPE, the simulated duration of VEGF suppression in the retina is approximately 50\% shorter than the observed duration of VEGF suppression in the aqueous humor, a ﬁnding that may explain the short duration of suppressed disease activity in the “high anti-VEGF demand” patients reported by Fauser and Muether (Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2016, 100, 1494−1498). At 10-fold lower values of pRPE, the durations of VEGF suppression in the retina and aqueous humor are comparable. Lastly we have used the model to explore the impact of dose and binding parameters on the duration and depth of VEGF suppression in the aqueous and retinal compartments. Our simulations with the three-compartment PK/PD model provide new insights into inter-patient variability in response to anti-VEGF therapy and oﬀer a mechanistic framework for developing treatment regimens and molecules that may prolong the duration of retinal VEGF suppression.},

  abstract = {Objective  Explore relationships between systemic exposure to intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) and systemic pharmacodynamic effects via post hoc analyses of clinical trials of IAI for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) or diabetic macular oedema (DME).
Methods and analysis  Adults from VGFT-OD-0702.PK (n=6), VGFT-OD-0512 (n= 5), VIEW 2 (n=1204) and VIVIDDME (n=404) studies were included. Validated ELISAs were used to measure concentrations of free and bound aflibercept (reported as adjusted bound) in plasma at predefined time points in each study. Non-compartmental analysis of concentration–time data was obtained with dense sampling in VGFT-OD-0702.PK and VGFT-OD-0512. Sparse sampling was used in VIEW 2 and VIVID-DME. Blood pressure or intrarenal function changes were also investigated.
Results  Following intravitreal administration, free aflibercept plasma concentrations quickly decreased once maximum concentrations were achieved at 1–3 days postdose; pharmacologically inactive adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations increased over a longer period and reached plateau 7 days postdose. Ratios of free and adjusted bound aflibercept decreased over time. There were no meaningful changes in systolic/diastolic blood pressure over the duration of each study at all systemic aflibercept exposure levels. For all treatment arms in VIEW 2, there was no clinically relevant change in mean intrarenal function from baseline at week 52. Overall, incidence of systemic adverse events in VIEW 2 and VIVIDDME was low and consistent with the known safety profile of IAI.
Conclusion  IAI administration was not associated with systemic effects in patients with nAMD or DME as measured by blood pressure or intrarenal function, two known pharmacologically relevant effects of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor.},

  abstract   = {Corneal epithelium and blood–retina barrier (i.e. retinal capillaries and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)) are the key membranes that regulate the access of xenobiotics into the ocular tissues. Corneal epithelium limits drug absorption from the lacrimal fluid into the anterior chamber after eyedrop administration, whereas blood–retina barrier restricts the entry of drugs from systemic circulation to the posterior eye segment. Like in general pharmacokinetics, the role of transporters has been considered to be quite limited as compared to the passive diffusion of drugs across the membranes. As the functional role of transporters is being revealed it has become evident that the transporters are widely important in pharmacokinetics. This review updates the current knowledge about the transporters in the corneal epithelium and blood–retina barrier and demonstrates that the information is far from complete. We also show that quite many ocular drugs are known to interact with transporters, but the studies about the expression and function of those transporters in the eye are still sparse. Therefore, the transporters probably have greater role in ocular pharmacokinetics than we currently realise.},

However, little information is currently available on the binding kinetics and relative biological activity of various VEGF inhibitors. Therefore, we have evaluated the binding kinetics of two anti-VEGF antibodies, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and VEGF Trap (also known as aflibercept), a novel type of soluble decoy receptor, with substantially higher affinity than conventional soluble VEGF receptors. VEGF Trap bound to all isoforms of human VEGF-A tested with subpicomolar affinity. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab also bound human VEGF-A, but with markedly lower affinity. The association rate for VEGF Trap binding to VEGF-A was orders of magnitude faster than that measured for bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Similarly, in cell-based bioassays, VEGF Trap inhibited the activation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, as well as VEGF-A induced calcium mobilization and migration in human endothelial cells more potently than ranibizumab or bevacizumab. Only VEGF Trap bound human PlGF and VEGF-B, and inhibited VEGFR1 activation and HUVEC migration induced by PlGF. These data differentiate VEGF Trap from ranibizumab and bevacizumab in terms of its markedly higher affinity for VEGF-A, as well as its ability to bind VEGF-B and PlGF.},

  abstract = {Background To develop a model of the pharmacokinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) determined in samples of aqueous humour from patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with ranibizumab (Lucentis).
Methods Post hoc analysis of data from 31 eyes of 31 patients with AMD treated with ranibizumab gathered in a non-randomised, prospective clinical study. VEGF-A concentrations were measured in 440 aqueous humour samples by Luminex multiplex bead analysis (Luminex, Austin, Texas, USA).
Results The kinetics of recovery of VEGF-A from suppression by ranibizumab were well described by a simple model: VEGF-A is produced at a constant individual rate; VEGF-A and ranibizumab disperse rapidly within the vitreous chamber and bind with a known afﬁnity; both are eliminated at identical rates from the vitreous chamber in a constant but individual ﬂow into the anterior chamber, and are ﬁnally cleared by draining into the peripheral circulation. Average rates of VEGF-A production were predicted to be 5.8 fmol/day (range: 2.7–10.1 fmol), and elimination half-times predicted to be 3.5 days (range: 2.3–5.5 days). The duration of complete VEGF-A suppression in the aqueous humour averaged 41 days (range: 28–67 days).
Conclusions The ocular pharmacokinetics of VEGF-A and ranibizumab have been linked for the ﬁrst time in a simple and plausible model which suggests that it might be possible to anticipate individual VEGF-A suppression times. Clinical trial number NCT01213667.},

To describe the pharmacokinetics of intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin®) in rabbits.
Methods:
The right eye of 20 rabbits was injected intravitreally with 1.25 mg/0.05 mL bevacizumab. Both eyes of four rabbits each time were enucleated at days 1, 3, 8, 15, and 29. Bevacizumab concentrations were measured in serum, aqueous humor, and vitreous.
Results:
Maximum vitreous (406.25 μg/mL) and aqueous humor (5.83 μg/mL) concentrations of bevacizumab in the right eye were measured at day 1. Serum bevacizumab concentration peaked at day 8 (0.413 μg/mL) and declined to 0.032 μg/mL at 4 weeks. Half-life values in right vitreous, right aqueous humor, and serum were 6.61, 6.51, and 5.87 days, respectively. Concentration of bevacizumab in the vitreous of the noninjected eye peaked at day 8 (0.335 ng/mL) and declined to 0.218 ng/mL at 4 weeks. In the aqueous humor of the noninjected eye, maximum concentration of bevacizumab was achieved at day 8 (1.6125 ng/mL) and declined (to 0.11 ng/mL) at 4 weeks.
Conclusion:
The vitreous half-life of 1.25 mg/0.05 mL intravitreal bevacizumab was 6.61 days in this rabbit model. Maximum concentrations of bevacizumab were reached at day 1 in both vitreous and aqueous humor of the right eye and at day 8 in the serum. Very low concentrations of bevacizumab were measured in the fellow noninjected eye.},
