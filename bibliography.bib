To describe the pharmacokinetics of intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin®) in rabbits.
Methods:
The right eye of 20 rabbits was injected intravitreally with 1.25 mg/0.05 mL bevacizumab. Both eyes of four rabbits each time were enucleated at days 1, 3, 8, 15, and 29. Bevacizumab concentrations were measured in serum, aqueous humor, and vitreous.
Results:
Maximum vitreous (406.25 μg/mL) and aqueous humor (5.83 μg/mL) concentrations of bevacizumab in the right eye were measured at day 1. Serum bevacizumab concentration peaked at day 8 (0.413 μg/mL) and declined to 0.032 μg/mL at 4 weeks. Half-life values in right vitreous, right aqueous humor, and serum were 6.61, 6.51, and 5.87 days, respectively. Concentration of bevacizumab in the vitreous of the noninjected eye peaked at day 8 (0.335 ng/mL) and declined to 0.218 ng/mL at 4 weeks. In the aqueous humor of the noninjected eye, maximum concentration of bevacizumab was achieved at day 8 (1.6125 ng/mL) and declined (to 0.11 ng/mL) at 4 weeks.
Conclusion:
The vitreous half-life of 1.25 mg/0.05 mL intravitreal bevacizumab was 6.61 days in this rabbit model. Maximum concentrations of bevacizumab were reached at day 1 in both vitreous and aqueous humor of the right eye and at day 8 in the serum. Very low concentrations of bevacizumab were measured in the fellow noninjected eye.},

  abstract = {Background To develop a model of the pharmacokinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) determined in samples of aqueous humour from patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with ranibizumab (Lucentis).
Methods Post hoc analysis of data from 31 eyes of 31 patients with AMD treated with ranibizumab gathered in a non-randomised, prospective clinical study. VEGF-A concentrations were measured in 440 aqueous humour samples by Luminex multiplex bead analysis (Luminex, Austin, Texas, USA).
Results The kinetics of recovery of VEGF-A from suppression by ranibizumab were well described by a simple model: VEGF-A is produced at a constant individual rate; VEGF-A and ranibizumab disperse rapidly within the vitreous chamber and bind with a known afﬁnity; both are eliminated at identical rates from the vitreous chamber in a constant but individual ﬂow into the anterior chamber, and are ﬁnally cleared by draining into the peripheral circulation. Average rates of VEGF-A production were predicted to be 5.8 fmol/day (range: 2.7–10.1 fmol), and elimination half-times predicted to be 3.5 days (range: 2.3–5.5 days). The duration of complete VEGF-A suppression in the aqueous humour averaged 41 days (range: 28–67 days).
Conclusions The ocular pharmacokinetics of VEGF-A and ranibizumab have been linked for the ﬁrst time in a simple and plausible model which suggests that it might be possible to anticipate individual VEGF-A suppression times. Clinical trial number NCT01213667.},

Long acting delivery systems are needed for prolongation of their dosing interval. Intravitreal biologicals are eliminated from the eye via the aqueous humor outflow. Thus, the anterior and posterior segments are exposed to the drug. We utilized a kinetic simulation model to estimate protein drug concentrations in the vitreous and aqueous humor after bolus injection and controlled release administration to the vitreous. The simulations predicted accurately the experimental levels of 5 biologicals in the vitreous and aqueous humor. The good match between the simulations and experimental data demonstrated almost complete anterior segment bioavailability, and major dose sparing with ocular controlled release systems. Overall, the model is a useful tool in the design of intraocular delivery of biologicals.},

  abstract = {Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF-A has proven to be effective in inhibiting angiogenesis and vascular leak associated with cancers and various eye diseases. However, little information is currently available on the binding kinetics and relative biological activity of various VEGF inhibitors. Therefore, we have evaluated the binding kinetics of two anti-VEGF antibodies, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, and VEGF Trap (also known as aflibercept), a novel type of soluble decoy receptor, with substantially higher affinity than conventional soluble VEGF receptors. VEGF Trap bound to all isoforms of human VEGF-A tested with subpicomolar affinity. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab also bound human VEGF-A, but with markedly lower affinity. The association rate for VEGF Trap binding to VEGF-A was orders of magnitude faster than that measured for bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Similarly, in cell-based bioassays, VEGF Trap inhibited the activation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, as well as VEGF-A induced calcium mobilization and migration in human endothelial cells more potently than ranibizumab or bevacizumab. Only VEGF Trap bound human PlGF and VEGF-B, and inhibited VEGFR1 activation and HUVEC migration induced by PlGF. These data differentiate VEGF Trap from ranibizumab and bevacizumab in terms of its markedly higher affinity for VEGF-A, as well as its ability to bind VEGF-B and PlGF.},

  abstract   = {Corneal epithelium and blood–retina barrier (i.e. retinal capillaries and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)) are the key membranes that regulate the access of xenobiotics into the ocular tissues. Corneal epithelium limits drug absorption from the lacrimal fluid into the anterior chamber after eyedrop administration, whereas blood–retina barrier restricts the entry of drugs from systemic circulation to the posterior eye segment. Like in general pharmacokinetics, the role of transporters has been considered to be quite limited as compared to the passive diffusion of drugs across the membranes. As the functional role of transporters is being revealed it has become evident that the transporters are widely important in pharmacokinetics. This review updates the current knowledge about the transporters in the corneal epithelium and blood–retina barrier and demonstrates that the information is far from complete. We also show that quite many ocular drugs are known to interact with transporters, but the studies about the expression and function of those transporters in the eye are still sparse. Therefore, the transporters probably have greater role in ocular pharmacokinetics than we currently realise.},

Methods and analysis  Adults from VGFT-OD-0702.PK (n=6), VGFT-OD-0512 (n= 5), VIEW 2 (n=1204) and VIVIDDME (n=404) studies were included. Validated ELISAs were used to measure concentrations of free and bound aflibercept (reported as adjusted bound) in plasma at predefined time points in each study. Non-compartmental analysis of concentration–time data was obtained with dense sampling in VGFT-OD-0702.PK and VGFT-OD-0512. Sparse sampling was used in VIEW 2 and VIVID-DME. Blood pressure or intrarenal function changes were also investigated.
Results  Following intravitreal administration, free aflibercept plasma concentrations quickly decreased once maximum concentrations were achieved at 1–3 days postdose; pharmacologically inactive adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations increased over a longer period and reached plateau 7 days postdose. Ratios of free and adjusted bound aflibercept decreased over time. There were no meaningful changes in systolic/diastolic blood pressure over the duration of each study at all systemic aflibercept exposure levels. For all treatment arms in VIEW 2, there was no clinically relevant change in mean intrarenal function from baseline at week 52. Overall, incidence of systemic adverse events in VIEW 2 and VIVIDDME was low and consistent with the known safety profile of IAI.
Conclusion  IAI administration was not associated with systemic effects in patients with nAMD or DME as measured by blood pressure or intrarenal function, two known pharmacologically relevant effects of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor.},

  abstract = {Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibodies or antibody fragments has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The ocular half-life (t1/2) of these large molecules, determined in ocular fluids or derived from serum levels, varies with molecular size and is larger in humans than in preclinical animal species. The high affinity binding of VEGF to these molecules lowers the free concentration of VEGF and reduces its occupancy on VEGF receptors in ocular tissues. To understand the biophysical determinants of t1/2 for anti-VEGF antibodies and the time-course of VEGF in ocular fluids, we developed a mechanistic model of intravitreal pharmacokinetics (IVT PK) for anti-VEGF antibodies and combined it with a mechanistic model of the pharmacodynamics (RVR PD) of VEGF suppression by ranibizumab, an anti-VEGF recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab). Our IVT PK model predicts that the ocular t1/2 of a large molecule will be approximately four-times the calculated value of its vitreous diffusion time (Tdiff), defined as rvit2/6D, where rvit is the radius of the vitreous chamber in that species (modeled as a sphere), and D is the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in physiological saline at 37 °C obtained from the Stokes–Einstein relation. This prediction is verified from a compilation of data and calculations on various large molecules in the human, monkey, rabbit, and rat and is consistent with the reported t1/2 values of ranibizumab in humans (mean value 7.9 days) and the calculated Tdiff of 1.59 days. Our RVR PD model is based on the publication of Saunders et al. (Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2015, 99, 1554−1559) who reported data on the time-course of VEGF levels in aqueous humor samples obtained from 31 patients receiving ranibizumab treatment for wet AMD and developed a compartmental mathematical model to describe the VEGF suppression profiles. We modified Saunders’ model with the known 2:1 stoichiometry of ranibizumab-VEGF binding and included the association and dissociation kinetics of the binding reactions. Using the RVR PD model, we reanalyzed Saunders’ data to estimate the in vivo dissociation constant (KD) between ranibizumab and VEGF. Our analysis demonstrates the delicate interrelationship between the in vivo KD value and the intravitreal half-life and yields an in vivo KD estimate that is appreciably larger than the in vitro KD estimates reported in the literature. Potential explanations for the difference between the in vivo and in vitro KD values, which appear to reflect the different methodologies and experimental conditions, are discussed. We conclude that the combined mechanistic model of IVT PK and RVR PD provides a useful framework for simulating the effects of dose, KD, and the molecular weight of VEGF-binding molecules on the duration of VEGF suppression.},

  abstract   = {Intravitreally (IVT) injected macromolecules for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration must permeate through the inner limiting membrane (ILM) into the retina and through the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to enter the choroid. A quantitative understanding of intraocular transport mechanisms, elimination pathways, and the effect of molecular size is currently incomplete. We present a semimechanistic, 3-compartment (retina, vitreous, and aqueous) pharmacokinetic (PK) model, expressed using linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to describe the molecular concentrations following a single IVT injection. The model was fit to experimental rabbit data, with Fab, Fc, IgG, and IgG null antibodies and antibody fragments, to estimate key ocular pharmacokinetic parameters. The model predicts an ocular half-life, t1/2, which is the same for all compartments and dependent on the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of the respective molecules, consistent with observations from the experimental data. Estimates of the permeabilities of the RPE and ILM are derived for Rh values ranging from 2.5 to 4.9 nm, and are found to be in good agreement with ex-vivo measurements from bovine eyes. We show that the ratio of these permeabilities largely determines the ratio of the molecular concentrations in the retina and vitreal compartments and their dependence on Rh. The model further provides estimates for the ratio of fluxes corresponding to the elimination pathways from the eye, i.e., aqueous humor to retina/choroid, which increase from 5:1 to 7:1 as Rh decreases. Our semimechanistic model provides a quantitative framework for interpreting ocular PK and the effects of molecule size on rate-determining parameters. We have shown that intraocular permeabilities can be reasonably estimated from 3-compartment ocular PK data and can determine how these parameters influence the half-life, retinal permeation, and elimination of intravitreally injected molecules from the eye.},

  abstract = {Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) results from the pathological angiogenesis of choroidal capillaries, which leak ﬂuid within or below the macular region of the retina. The current standard of care for treating wet AMD utilizes intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF antibodies or antibody fragments to suppress ocular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. While VEGF suppression has been demonstrated in wet AMD patients by serial measurements of free-VEGF concentrations in aqueous humor samples, it is presumed that anti-VEGF molecules also permeate across the inner limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina as well as the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and suppress VEGF levels in the retina and/or choroidal regions. The latter eﬀects are inferred from serial optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of ﬂuid in the retinal and sub-retinal spaces. In order to gain theoretical insights to the dynamics of retinal levels of free-VEGF following intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF molecules, we have extended our previous two-compartment pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of ranibizumab−VEGF suppression in vitreous and aqueous humors to a three-compartment model that includes the retinal compartment. In the new model, reference values for the macromolecular permeability coeﬃcients between retina and vitreous (pILM) and between retina and choroid (pRPE) were estimated from PK data obtained in rabbit. With these values, the three-compartment model was used to re-analyze the aqueous humor levels of free-VEGF obtained in wet AMD patients treated with ranibizumab and to compare them to the simulated retinal levels of free-VEGF, including the observed variability in PK and PD. We have also used the model to explore the impact of varying pILM and pRPE to assess the case in which an anti-VEGF molecule is impermeable to the ILM and to assess the potential eﬀects of AMD pathology on the RPE barrier. Our simulations show that, for the reference values of pILM and pRPE, the simulated duration of VEGF suppression in the retina is approximately 50\% shorter than the observed duration of VEGF suppression in the aqueous humor, a ﬁnding that may explain the short duration of suppressed disease activity in the “high anti-VEGF demand” patients reported by Fauser and Muether (Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2016, 100, 1494−1498). At 10-fold lower values of pRPE, the durations of VEGF suppression in the retina and aqueous humor are comparable. Lastly we have used the model to explore the impact of dose and binding parameters on the duration and depth of VEGF suppression in the aqueous and retinal compartments. Our simulations with the three-compartment PK/PD model provide new insights into inter-patient variability in response to anti-VEGF therapy and oﬀer a mechanistic framework for developing treatment regimens and molecules that may prolong the duration of retinal VEGF suppression.},

This study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of adjunct SRT to anti-VEGF injections in a treat-and-extend regimen in nAMD.
Methods 50 consecutive patients were followed 3 years after single-session SRT, a safety analysis including standardised study imaging, and a reading centre based image analysis was performed after 2 years.
Results After increase from baseline (4.24±0.66 weeks) to 12 months (7.52±3.05 weeks, p{\textless}0.001), mean recurrence-free anti-VEGF treatment interval remained stable at 24 (7.40±3.17, p=0.746) and 36 months (6.89±3.00, p=0.175). Mean visual acuity change was −5.8±15.9 and −11.0±20.1 letters at 24 and 36 months, respectively. 36\% of eyes showed microvascular abnormalities (MVAs) on colour fundus photography and/or fluoresceine angiography most frequently located in parafoveal inferior and nasal regions.
Conclusion In real life, low-energy SRT was associated with a reduced anti-VEGF injection frequency through year 3. However, due to an observed visual acuity reduction and remarkable number of MVAs, a close follow-up of these patients is recommended. The real-life use, optimal treatment schedule and dose should be rediscussed critically.},

A comprehensive review of the preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic data that were obtained in different studies with intravitreal bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept has been conducted. Moreover, the factors that can influence the vitreous pharmacokinetics of these drugs, as well as the methods that were used in the studies for analytical determination, have been exposed. These anti-VEGF drugs present different charge and molecular weights, which play an important role in vitreous distribution and elimination. The pharmacokinetic parameters that were collected differ depending on the species that were involved in the studies and on physiological and pathological conditions, such as vitrectomy and lensectomy. Knowledge of the intravitreal pharmacokinetics of the anti-VEGF drugs that were used in clinical practice is of vital importance.},

  abstract = {Drug delivery to the posterior eye segment is an important challenge in ophthalmology, because many diseases affect the retina and choroid leading to impaired vision or blindness. Currently, intravitreal injections are the method of choice to administer drugs to the retina, but this approach is applicable only in selected cases (e.g. anti-VEGF antibodies and soluble receptors). There are two basic approaches that can be adopted to improve retinal drug delivery: prolonged and/or retina targeted delivery of intravitreal drugs and use of other routes of drug administration, such as periocular, suprachoroidal, sub-retinal, systemic, or topical. Properties of the administration route, drug and delivery system determine the efficacy and safety of these approaches. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors determine the required dosing rates and doses that are needed for drug action. In addition, tolerability factors limit the use of many materials in ocular drug delivery. This review article provides a critical discussion of retinal drug delivery, particularly from the pharmacokinetic point of view. This article does not include an extensive review of drug delivery technologies, because they have already been reviewed several times recently. Instead, we aim to provide a systematic and quantitative view on the pharmacokinetic factors in drug delivery to the posterior eye segment. This review is based on the literature and unpublished data from the authors' laboratory.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop a generative mathematical model of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and model the impact of injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor to virtual patients with the condition.  Methods We isolated key pathophysiological components of macular degeneration in terms of macular edema development and response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. We developed mathematical models for each of these components using constants determined from published biological experimentation. Consequently, we combined the mathematical models of the separate components to arrive at an end-to-end model of the evolution of macular edema size and its response to treatment.  Results We present a series of simulations based upon our idealised model. Initially, we demonstrate the theoretical change in macular edema height in wet macular degeneration over time without and with anti-VEGF interventions. In our final simulation, we demonstrate the powerful possibilities of virtual clinical trials by simulating a virtual model of a landmark study using our existing mathematical AMD model.  Conclusions Using our mathematical modelling based upon known pathological and pharmacological processes we have been able to model the effect of intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent on macular edema from age related macular degeneration. We were subsequently able to mathematically simulate a major clinical trial with results that mirror many key features of the clinical established study. We anticipate that the generative model presented here can evolve to be a useful supportive tool in the challenge to deliver optimal therapy for patients with wet macular degeneration.},

  abstract = {Regulatory authorities require that the safety and efficacy of a new high-risk medical device be proven in a Clinical Trial (CT), in which the effects of the device on a group of patients are compared to the effects of the current standard of care. Phase III trials can run for several years, cost millions of dollars, and expose patients to an unproven device. In this paper, we demonstrate how to use a large group of synthetic patients based on computer modeling to improve the planning of a CT so as to increase the chances of a successful trial for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). We developed a computer model of the electrical generation and propagation in the heart. This model was used to generate a large group of heart instances capable of producing episodes of 19 different arrhythmias. We also implemented two arrhythmia detection algorithms from the literature: Rhythm ID from Boston Scientific and PR Logic + Wavelet from Medtronic. Using this setup, we conducted multiple in-silico trials to compare the ability of the two algorithms to appropriately discriminate between potentially fatal Ventricular Tachy-arrhythmias (VT) and nonfatal Supra-Ventricular Tachy-arrhythmias (SVTs). The results of our in-silico trial indicate that Rhythm ID was less able to discriminate between SVT and VT and so may lead to more cases of inappropriate therapy. This corroborates the findings of the Rhythm ID Going Head to Head Trial (RIGHT), a clinical trial that compared the two algorithms in patients. We further demonstrated that the result continues to hold if we vary the distribution of arrhythmias in the synthetic population. We also used the same in-silico cohort to explore the sensitivity of the outcome to different parameter settings of the device algorithms, which is not feasible in a real clinical trial. In-silico trials can provide early insight into the factors which affect the outcome of a CT at a fraction of the cost and duration and without the ethical issues.},

  abstract   = {Interventional neuroradiology is characterized by engineering- and experience-driven device development with design improvements every few months. However, clinical validation of these new devices requires lengthy and expensive randomized controlled trials. This contribution proposes a machine learning-based in silico study design to evaluate new devices more quickly with a small sample size. Acute diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI, segmented one-week follow-up imaging, and clinical variables were available for 90 acute ischemic stroke patients. Three treatment option-specific random forest models were trained to predict the one-week follow-up lesion segmentation for (1) patients successfully recanalized using intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, (2) patients successfully recanalized using intravenous thrombolysis, and (3) non-recanalizing patients as an analogue for conservative treatment for each patient in the sample, independent of the true group membership. A repeated-measures analysis of the three predicted follow-up lesions for each patient revealed significantly larger lesions for the non-recanalizing group compared to the successful intravenous thrombolysis treatment group, which in turn showed significantly larger lesions compared to the successful mechanical thrombectomy treatment group (p {\textless} 0.001). A groupwise comparison of the true follow-up lesions for the three treatment options showed the same trend but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.19). We conclude that the proposed machine learning-based in silico trial design leads to clinically feasible results and can support new efficacy studies by providing additional power and potential early intermediate results.},

  abstract   = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to severe social and economic disruption worldwide. Although currently no consent has been reached on a specific therapy that can treat COVID-19 effectively, several inhalation therapy strategies have been proposed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. These strategies include inhalations of antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and vaccines. To investigate how to enhance the therapeutic effect by increasing the delivery efficiency (DE) of the inhaled aerosolized drug particles, a patient-specific tracheobronchial (TB) tree from the trachea up to generation 6 (G6) with moderate COVID-19 symptoms was selected as a testbed for the in silico trials of targeted drug delivery to the lung regions with pneumonia alba, i.e., the severely affected lung segments (SALS). The 3D TB tree geometry was reconstructed from spiral computed tomography (CT) scanned images. The airflow field and particle trajectories were solved using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based Euler-Lagrange model at an inhalation flow rate of 15 L/min. Particle release maps, which record the deposition locations of the released particles, were obtained at the inlet according to the particle trajectories. Simulation results show that particles with different diameters have similar release maps for targeted delivery to SALS. Point-source aerosol release (PSAR) method can significantly enhance the DE into the SALS. A C++ program has been developed to optimize the location of the PSAR tube. The optimized simulations indicate that the PSAR approach can at least increase the DE of the SALS by a factor of 3.2× higher than conventional random-release drug-aerosol inhalation. The presence of the PSAR tube only leads to a 7.12\% change in DE of the SALS. This enables the fast design of a patient-specific treatment for reginal lung diseases.,                         Unlabelled Image},

  abstract = {Therapies for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) involve a variety of medications, depending on the stage of T2D progression. It is now an accepted knowledge that in silico trials can help to accelerate drug development and support treatment optimization. A T2D simulator (T2DS), consisting of a model of the glucose-insulin system and an in silico population describing glucose-insulin dynamics in T2D subjects, has been recently developed based on early-stage T2D data, studied with sophisticated experimental techniques. This limits the domain of validity of the simulator to this specific sub-population of T2D. Here we proposed a method for tuning the T2DS to any desired T2D target population, e.g. insulin-naïve (i.e., not experienced with insulin) patients, without the need to resort to complex and expensive clinical studies. This will allow to use the T2DS for testing treatments in the target population. To illustrate the methodology, we used a case study: extending the T2DS to reproduce the behavior of insulin-naïve T2D subjects. The methodology described here can be extended to other stages of T2D, allowing an extensive in silico testing phase of different treatments before human trials.},

  abstract   = {Background: In silico trials in type 2 diabetes (T2D) would be useful for testing diabetes treatments and accelerating the development of new antidiabetic drugs. In this study, we present a T2D simulator able to reproduce the variability observed in a T2D population. The simulator also allows to safely experiment on virtual subjects with severe (and possibly rare) pathological conditions. Methods: A meal simulation model of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide systems, made of 15 differential equations and 39 parameters, has been identified using a system decomposition and forcing function Bayesian strategy on data of 51 T2D subjects undergoing a single triple-tracer mixed meal. One hundred T2D in silico subjects have been generated from the joint distribution of estimated model parameters. A case study is presented to illustrate the simulator use for testing a virtual drug (improving insulin action and secretion) in a subpopulation of rare, extremely impaired, T2D subjects. Results: The model well fitted T2D data and parameters were estimated with precision. Simulated plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide well matched the data (e.g., median [25th-75th percentile] glucose area under the curves of 6.9 [6.1-8.5] 104 mg/dL·min in silico vs. 7.0 [5.6-8.2] 104 mg/dL·min in vivo). The potential use of the simulator was shown in a case study, in which the (virtual) antidiabetic drug dose was optimized for very insulin-resistant T2D subjects. Conclusions: We have developed a T2D simulator that captures the behavior of T2D population during a meal, both in terms of average and intersubject variability. The simulator represents a cost-effective way to test new antidiabetic drugs, before moving to human trials.},

  abstract = {A type 2 diabetes (T2D) simulator has been recently proposed for supporting drug development and treatment optimization. This tool consists of a physiological model of glucose/insulin/C-peptide dynamics and a virtual cohort of T2D subjects (i.e., random extractions of model parameterizations from a joint parameter distribution) well describing both average and variability realistic T2D dynamics . However, the state-of-art procedure to get a reliable virtual population requires some post-processing after subject extraction, in order to discard implausible behaviors. We propose an improved method for virtual subjects' generation to overcome this burdensome task. To do so, we first assessed a refined joint parameter distribution, from which extracting a number of subjects, greater than the target population size. Then, target-size subsets are undersampled from the large cohort. The final virtual population is selected among the subsets as the one maximizing the similarity with T2D data and model parameter distribution, by means of measurement' outcome metrics and Euclidian distance (Δ), respectively. In the final population, almost all the outcome metrics are statistically identical to the clinical counterparts (p-value{\textgreater}0.05) and model parameters' distribution differs by {\textasciitilde}5-10\% from that derived from data. The methodology described here is flexible, thus resulting suitable for different T2D stages and type 1 diabetes, as well.Clinical Relevance- A straightforward subjects' generation would ease the availability of tailored in silico trials for testing diabetes treatment in a specific population.},

  abstract   = {Historically, the evidences of safety and efficacy that companies provide to regulatory agencies as support to the request for marketing authorization of a new medical product have been produced experimentally, either in vitro or in vivo. More recently, regulatory agencies started receiving and accepting evidences obtained in silico, i.e. through modelling and simulation. However, before any method (experimental or computational) can be acceptable for regulatory submission, the method itself must be considered “qualified” by the regulatory agency. This involves the assessment of the overall “credibility” that such a method has in providing specific evidence for a given regulatory procedure. In this paper, we describe a methodological framework for the credibility assessment of computational models built using mechanistic knowledge of physical and chemical phenomena, in addition to available biological and physiological knowledge; these are sometimes referred to as “biophysical” models. Using guiding examples, we explore the definition of the context of use, the risk analysis for the definition of the acceptability thresholds, and the various steps of a comprehensive verification, validation and uncertainty quantification process, to conclude with considerations on the credibility of a prediction for a specific context of use. While this paper does not provide a guideline for the formal qualification process, which only the regulatory agencies can provide, we expect it to help researchers to better appreciate the extent of scrutiny required, which should be considered early on in the development/use of any (new) in silico evidence.},

As In Silico Trials are a disruptively innovative class of new methodologies, it is important to have a list of possible CoUs highlighting potential applications for the development of the relative regulatory science. This review paper presents the result of a consensus process that took place in the InSilicoWorld Community of Practice, an online forum for experts in in silico medicine. The experts involved identified 46 descriptions of possible CoUs which were organised into a candidate taxonomy of nine CoU categories. Examples of 31 CoUs were identified in the available literature; the remaining 15 should, for now, be considered speculative.},

Exudative AMD is characterized by the angiogenesis of blood vessels growing from underneath the macula, crossing the blood–retina barrier (which comprises Bruch’s membrane (BM) and the retinal pigmentation epithelium (RPE)), leaking blood and fluid into the retina and knocking off photoreceptors. Here, we simulate a computational model of angiogenesis from the choroid blood vessels via a cellular Potts model, as well as BM, RPE cells, drusen deposits and photoreceptors. Our results indicate that improving AMD may require fixing the impaired lateral adhesion between RPE cells and with BM, as well as diminishing Vessel Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Jagged proteins that affect the Notch signaling pathway. Our numerical simulations suggest that anti-VEGF and anti-Jagged therapies could temporarily halt exudative AMD while addressing impaired cellular adhesion, which could be more effective over a longer time-span.},

We used the UVA/Padova Type 1 Diabetes Simulator to in silico test safety and efficacy of this algorithm in different scenarios. Methods: We tested five configurations of the AndroidAPS algorithm differing in aggressiveness and patient's interaction with the system. All configurations were tested with insulin sensitivity variation of ±30\%. The most promising configurations were tested in real-life scenarios: over- and underestimated bolus by 50\%, bolus delivered 15 min before meal, and late bolus delivered 15 min after meal. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) time in ranges (TIRs) metrics were used to assess the glycemic control. Results: In silico testing showed that open-source closed-loop system AndroidAPS works effectively and safely. The best results were reached if AndroidAPS algorithm worked with microboluses and when half of calculated bolus was issued (mean glycemia 131 mg/dL, SD 27 mg/dL, TIR 91\%, time between 54 and 70 mg/dL {\textless}1\%, and low blood glucose index even {\textless}1). The meal bolus over- and underestimation as well as late bolus did not affect the TIR and, importantly, the time between 54 and 70 mg/dL. Conclusion: In silico testing proved that AndroidAPS implementation of the OpenAPS algorithm is safe and effective, and it showed a great potential to be tested in prospective home setting study.},

The aim of this in silico study is a virtual memantine therapy for Alzheimer's disease that provides a different perspective on clinical trials; An in silico randomised trial using virtual hippocampi to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease with doses of memantine 3-30 µM compared to placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of impulses (spikes). Secondary endpoints included interspike interval and frequency; The number of virtual moderate-AD hippocampal spikes was significantly lower, at 1648.7 (95\% CI, 1344.5-1952.9), versus those treated with the 3 µM dose, 2324.7 (95\% CI, 2045.9-2603.5), and the 10 µM dose, 3607.0 (95\% CI, 3137.6-4076.4). In contrast, the number of virtual spikes (spikes) of severe AD of the hippocampus was significantly lower, at 1461.8 (95\% CI, 1196.2-1727.4), versus those treated with the 10 µM dose, at 2734.5 (95\% CI, 2369.8-3099.2), and the 30 µM dose, at 3748.9 (95\% CI, 3219.8-4278.0). The results of the analysis of secondary endpoints, interspike intervals and frequencies changed statistically significantly relative to the placebo; The results of the in silico study confirm that memantine monotherapy is effective in the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, as assessed by various neuronal parameters.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Model-based approaches to safety and efficacy assessment of pharmacological drugs, treatment strategies, or medical devices (In Silico Clinical Trial, ISCT) aim to decrease time and cost for the needed experimentations, reduce animal and human testing, and enable precision medicine. Unfortunately, in presence of non-identifiable models (e.g., reaction networks), parameter estimation is not enough to generate complete populations of Virtual Patient (VPs), i.e., populations guaranteed to show the entire spectrum of model behaviours (phenotypes), thus ensuring representativeness of the trial. RESULTS: We present methods and software based on global search driven by statistical model checking that, starting from a (non-identifiable) quantitative model of the human physiology (plus drugs PK/PD) and suitable biological and medical knowledge elicited from experts, compute a population of VPs whose behaviours are representative of the whole spectrum of phenotypes entailed by the model (completeness) and pairwise distinguishable according to user-provided criteria. This enables full granularity control on the size of the population to employ in an ISCT, guaranteeing representativeness while avoiding over-representation of behaviours.We proved the effectiveness of our algorithm on a non-identifiable ODE-based model of the female Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal axis, by generating a population of 4 830 264 VPs stratified into 7 levels (at different granularity of behaviours), and assessed its representativeness against 86 retrospective health records from Pfizer, Hannover Medical School and University Hospital of Lausanne. The datasets are respectively covered by our VPs within Average Normalised Mean Absolute Error of 15\%, 20\%, and 35\% (90\% of the latter dataset is covered within 20\% error).},

We present the flow diverter performance assessment (FD-PASS) in-silico trial, which models the treatment of intracranial aneurysms in 164 virtual patients with 82 distinct anatomies with a flow-diverting stent, using computational fluid dynamics to quantify post-treatment flow reduction. The predicted FD-PASS flow-diversion success rates replicate the values previously reported in three clinical trials. The in-silico approach allows broader investigation of factors associated with insufficient flow reduction than feasible in a conventional trial. Our findings demonstrate that in-silico trials of endovascular medical devices can: (i) replicate findings of conventional clinical trials, and (ii) perform virtual experiments and sub-group analyses that are difficult or impossible in conventional trials to discover new insights on treatment failure, e.g. in the presence of side-branches or hypertension.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the inception of computer modeling and simulation in life science is a matter of fact. This is one of the reasons why regulatory authorities are open in considering in silico trials evidence for the assessment of safeness and efficacy of medicinal products. In this context, mechanistic Agent-Based Models are increasingly used. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of consensus in the verification assessment of Agent-Based Models for regulatory approval needs. VV\&UQ is an ASME standard specifically suited for the verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification of medical devices. However, it can also be adapted for the verification assessment of in silico trials for medicinal products. RESULTS: Here, we propose a set of automatic tools for the mechanistic Agent-Based Model verification assessment. As a working example, we applied the verification framework to an Agent-Based Model in silico trial used in the COVID-19 context. CONCLUSIONS: Using the described verification computational workflow allows researchers and practitioners to easily perform verification steps to prove Agent-Based Models robustness and correctness that provide strong evidence for further regulatory requirements.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Clinical trials testing pharmacogenomic-guided warfarin dosing for patients with atrial fibrillation have demonstrated conflicting results. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are expensive and contraindicated for several conditions. A strategy optimizing anticoagulant selection remains an unmet clinical need. METHODS AND RESULTS: Characteristics from 14 206 patients with atrial fibrillation were integrated into a validated warfarin clinical trial simulation framework using iterative Bayesian network modeling and a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Individual dose-response for patients was simulated for 5 warfarin protocols-a fixed-dose protocol, a clinically guided protocol, and 3 increasingly complex pharmacogenomic-guided protocols. For each protocol, a complexity score was calculated using the variables predicting warfarin dose and the number of predefined international normalized ratio (INR) thresholds for each adjusted dose. Study outcomes included optimal time in therapeutic range ≥65\% and clinical events. A combination of age and genotype identified different optimal protocols for various subpopulations. A fixed-dose protocol provided well-controlled INR only in normal responders ≥65, whereas for normal responders {\textless}65 years old, a clinically guided protocol was necessary to achieve well-controlled INR. Sensitive responders ≥65 and {\textless}65 and highly sensitive responders ≥65 years old required pharmacogenomic-guided protocols to achieve well-controlled INR. However, highly sensitive responders {\textless}65 years old did not achieve well-controlled INR and had higher associated clinical events rates than other subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: Under the assumptions of this simulation, patients with atrial fibrillation can be triaged to an optimal warfarin therapy protocol by age and genotype. Clinicians should consider alternative anticoagulation therapy for patients with suboptimal outcomes under any warfarin protocol.},

Current animal models raise ethical and translational questions, and have limited accuracy in clinical risk prediction. Human-based computer models constitute a fast, cheap and potentially effective alternative to experimental assays, also facilitating translation to human. Key challenges include consideration of inter-cellular variability in drug responses and integration of computational and experimental methods in safety pharmacology. Our aim is to evaluate the ability of in silico drug trials in populations of human action potential (AP) models to predict clinical risk of drug-induced arrhythmias based on ion channel information, and to compare simulation results against experimental assays commonly used for drug testing. A control population of 1,213 human ventricular AP models in agreement with experimental recordings was constructed. In silico drug trials were performed for 62 reference compounds at multiple concentrations, using pore-block drug models (IC50/Hill coefficient). Drug-induced changes in AP biomarkers were quantified, together with occurrence of repolarization/depolarization abnormalities. Simulation results were used to predict clinical risk based on reports of Torsade de Pointes arrhythmias, and further evaluated in a subset of compounds through comparison with electrocardiograms from rabbit wedge preparations and Ca2+-transient recordings in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs). Drug-induced changes in silico vary in magnitude depending on the specific ionic profile of each model in the population, thus allowing to identify cell sub-populations at higher risk of developing abnormal AP phenotypes. Models with low repolarization reserve (increased Ca2+/late Na+ currents and Na+/Ca2+-exchanger, reduced Na+/K+-pump) are highly vulnerable to drug-induced repolarization abnormalities, while those with reduced inward current density (fast/late Na+ and Ca2+ currents) exhibit high susceptibility to depolarization abnormalities. Repolarization abnormalities in silico predict clinical risk for all compounds with 89\% accuracy. Drug-induced changes in biomarkers are in overall agreement across different assays: in silico AP duration changes reflect the ones observed in rabbit QT interval and hiPS-CMs Ca2+-transient, and simulated upstroke velocity captures variations in rabbit QRS complex. Our results demonstrate that human in silico drug trials constitute a powerful methodology for prediction of clinical pro-arrhythmic cardiotoxicity, ready for integration in the existing drug safety assessment pipelines.},

In recent years, new approaches in modelling and simulation have started to provide important insights in biomedicine, opening the way for their potential use in the reduction, refinement and partial substitution of both animal and human experimentation. In light of this evidence, the European Parliament and the United States Congress made similar recommendations to their respective regulators to allow wider use of modelling and simulation within the regulatory process. In the context of in silico medicine, the term 'in silico clinical trials' refers to the development of patient-specific models to form virtual cohorts for testing the safety and/or efficacy of new drugs and of new medical devices. Moreover, it could be envisaged that a virtual set of patients could complement a clinical trial (reducing the number of enrolled patients and improving statistical significance), and/or advise clinical decisions. This article will review the current state of in silico clinical trials and outline directions for a full-scale adoption of patient-specific modelling and simulation in the regulatory evaluation of biomedical products. In particular, we will focus on the development of vaccine therapies, which represents, in our opinion, an ideal target for this innovative approach.},

Perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFAS), such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are persistent, globally disseminated environmental contaminants known to be immunotoxic. Elevated PFAS exposure is associated with lower antibody responses to vaccinations in children and in adults. In addition, some studies have reported a correlation between PFAS levels in the body and lower resistance to disease, in other words an increased risk of infections or cancers. In this context, modelling and simulation platforms could be used to simulate the human immune system with the aim to evaluate the adverse effects that immunotoxicants may have. Here, we show the conditions under which a mathematical model developed for one purpose and application (e.g., in the pharmaceutical domain) can be successfully translated and transferred to another (e.g., in the chemicals domain) without undergoing significant adaptation. In particular, we demonstrate that the Universal Immune System Simulator was able to simulate the effects of PFAS on the immune system, introducing entities and new interactions that are biologically involved in the phenomenon. This also revealed a potentially exploitable pathway for assessing immunotoxicity through a computational model.},

In the context of setting up in silico trials for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, the effect of a stroke on perfusion and metabolism of brain tissue should be modelled to predict final infarcted brain tissue. This requires coupling of blood flow and tissue perfusion models. A one-dimensional intracranial blood flow model and a method to couple this to a brain tissue perfusion model for patient-specific simulations is presented. Image-based patient-specific data on the anatomy of the circle of Willis are combined with literature data and models for vessel anatomy not visible in the images, to create an extended model for each patient from the larger vessels down to the pial surface. The coupling between arterial blood flow and tissue perfusion occurs at the pial surface through the estimation of perfusion territories. The coupling method is able to accurately estimate perfusion territories. Finally, we argue that blood flow can be approximated as steady-state flow at the interface between arterial blood flow and tissue perfusion to reduce the cost of organ-scale simulations.},

This study aims at quantifying the contribution of variability in ventricular and torso anatomies to differences in QRS complexes of the 12-lead ECG using computer simulations. METHODS: A computational pipeline is presented that enables computer simulations using human torso/biventricular anatomically based electrophysiological models from clinically standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ventricular model includes membrane kinetics represented by the biophysically detailed O'Hara Rudy model modified for tissue heterogeneity and includes fiber orientation based on the Streeter rule. A population of 265 torso/biventricular models was generated by combining ventricular and torso anatomies obtained from clinically standard MRIs, augmented with a statistical shape model of the body. 12-lead ECGs were simulated on the 265 human torso/biventricular electrophysiology models, and QRS morphology, duration and amplitude were quantified in each ECG lead for each of the human torso-biventricular models. RESULTS: QRS morphologies in limb leads are mainly determined by ventricular anatomy, while in the precordial leads, and especially V1 to V4, they are determined by heart position within the torso. Differences in ventricular orientation within the torso can explain morphological variability from monophasic to biphasic QRS complexes. QRS duration is mainly influenced by myocardial volume, while it is hardly affected by the torso anatomy or position. An average increase of 0.12 ± 0.05 ms in QRS duration is obtained for each cm3 of myocardial volume across all the leads while it hardly changed due to changes in torso volume. CONCLUSION: Computer simulations using populations of human torso/biventricular models based on clinical MRI enable quantification of anatomical causes of variability in the QRS complex of the 12-lead ECG. The human models presented also pave the way toward their use as testbeds in silico clinical trials.},

In silico trials have the potential to refine, reduce cost, and partially replace current in vivo studies, namely clinical trials and animal testing. We present the design and implementation of an in silico trial for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. We propose an event-based modelling approach for the simulation of a disease and injury, where changes to the state of the system (the events) are assumed to be instantaneous. Using this approach we are able to combine a diverse set of models, spanning multiple time scales, to model acute ischemic stroke, treatment, and resulting brain tissue injury. The in silico trial is designed to be modular to aid development and reproducibility. It provides a comprehensive framework for application to any potential in silico trial. A statistical population model is used to generate cohorts of virtual patients. Patient functional outcomes are also predicted with a statistical model, using treatment and injury results and the patient's clinical parameters. We demonstrate the functionality of the event-based modelling approach and trial framework by running proof of concept in silico trials. The proof of concept trials simulate the same cohort of patients twice: once with successful treatment (successful recanalisation) and once with unsuccessful treatment (unsuccessful treatment). Ways to overcome some of the challenges and difficulties in setting up such an in silico trial are discussed, such as validation and computational limitations.},

In evaluating the potential synergism of combining such strategies, however, we should consider the possibility of constraining trade-off phenotypes such as impairment in wound healing and immune response, tissue dysfunction and tumorigenesis. Moreover, we are rapidly learning that the benefit/risk ratio of aging-targeted interventions largely depends on intra- and inter-individual variations of susceptibility to the healthspan-, resilience-, and/or lifespan-promoting effects of the interventions. Here, we exemplify how computationally-generated proxies of the efficacy of a given lifespan/healthspan-promoting approach can predict the impact of baseline epigenetic heterogeneity on the positive outcomes of ketogenic diet and mTOR inhibition as single or combined anti-aging strategies. We therefore propose that stochastic biomathematical modeling and computational simulation platforms should be developed as in silico strategies to accelerate the performance of clinical trials targeting human aging, and to provide personalized approaches and robust biomarkers of healthy aging at the individual-to-population levels.},

  abstract = {Development of an effective artificial pancreas (AP) controller to deliver insulin autonomously to people with type 1 diabetes mellitus is a difficult task. In this paper, three enhancements to a clinically validated AP model predictive controller (MPC) are proposed that address major challenges facing automated blood glucose control, and are then evaluated by both in silico tests and clinical trials. First, the core model of insulin-blood glucose dynamics utilized in the MPC is expanded with a medically inspired personalization scheme to improve controller responses in the face of inter- and intra-individual variations in insulin sensitivity. Next, the asymmetric nature of the short-term consequences of hypoglycemia versus hyperglycemia is incorporated in an asymmetric weighting of the MPC cost function. Finally, an enhanced dynamic insulin-on-board algorithm is proposed to minimize the likelihood of controller-induced hypoglycemia following a rapid rise of blood glucose due to rescue carbohydrate load with accompanying insulin suspension. Each advancement is evaluated separately and in unison through in silico trials based on a new clinical protocol, which incorporates induced hyper- and hypoglycemia to test robustness. The advancements are also evaluated in an advisory mode (simulated) testing of clinical data. The combination of the three proposed advancements show statistically significantly improved performance over the nonpersonalized controller without any enhancements across all metrics, displaying increased time in the 70-180 mg/dL safe glycemic range (76.9 versus 68.8\%) and the 80-140 mg/dL euglycemic range (48.1 versus 44.5\%), without a statistically significant increase in instances of hypoglycemia. The proposed advancements provide safe control action for AP applications, personalizing and improving controller performance without the need for extensive model identification processes.},

  abstract   = {Arguably, a minimally invasive system using subcutaneous (s.c.) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and s.c. insulin delivery via insulin pump would be a most feasible step to closed-loop control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Consequently, diabetes technology is focusing on developing an artificial pancreas using control algorithms to link CGM with s.c. insulin delivery. The future development of the artificial pancreas will be greatly accelerated by employing mathematical modeling and computer simulation. Realistic computer simulation is capable of providing invaluable information about the safety and the limitations of closed-loop control algorithms, guiding clinical studies, and out-ruling ineffective control scenarios in a cost-effective manner. Thus computer simulation testing of closed-loop control algorithms is regarded as a prerequisite to clinical trials of the artificial pancreas. In this paper, we present a system for in silico testing of control algorithms that has three principal components: (1) a large cohort of n=300 simulated "subjects" (n=100 adults, 100 adolescents, and 100 children) based on real individuals' data and spanning the observed variability of key metabolic parameters in the general population of people with T1DM; (2) a simulator of CGM sensor errors representative of Freestyle Navigator™, Guardian RT, or Dexcom™ STS™, 7-day sensor; and (3) a simulator of discrete s.c. insulin delivery via OmniPod Insulin Management System or Deltec Cozmo(®) insulin pump. The system has been shown to represent adequate glucose fluctuations in T1DM observed during meal challenges, and has been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration as a substitute to animal trials in the preclinical testing of closed-loop control strategies.},

INSIST will generate virtual populations of acute ischemic stroke patients based on anonymized data from the recent stroke trials and registry, and build on the existing and emerging in-silico models for acute ischemic stroke, its treatment (thrombolysis and thrombectomy) and the resulting perfusion changes. These models will be used to design a platform for in-silico trials that will be validated with existing data and be used to provide a proof of concept of the potential efficacy of this emerging technology. The platform will be used for preliminary evaluation of the potential suitability and safety of medication, new thrombectomy device configurations and methods to select patient subpopulations for better treatment outcome. This could allow generating, exploring and refining relavant hypotheses on potential causal pathways (which may follow from the evidence obtained from clinical trials) and improving clinical trial design. Importantly, the findings of the in-silico trials will require validation under the controlled settings of randomized clinical trials.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Intrathecal drug delivery has a significant role in pain management and central nervous system (CNS) disease therapeutics. A fluid-physics based tool to assist clinicians in choosing specific drug doses to the spine or brain may help improve treatment schedules. METHODS: This study applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and in vitro model verification to assess intrathecal drug delivery in an anatomically idealized model of the human CSF system with key anatomic features of the CNS. Key parameters analyzed included the role of (a) injection location including lumbar puncture (LP), cisterna magna (CM) and intracerebroventricular (ICV), (b) LP injection rate, injection volume, and flush volume, (c) physiologic factors including cardiac-induced and deep respiration-induced CSF stroke volume increase. Simulations were conducted for 3-h post-injection and used to quantify spatial-temporal tracer concentration, regional area under the curve (AUC), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), and maximum concentration (Cmax), for each case. RESULTS: CM and ICV increased AUC to brain regions by {\textasciitilde} 2 logs compared to all other simulations. A 3X increase in bolus volume and addition of a 5 mL flush both increased intracranial AUC to the brain up to 2X compared to a baseline 5 mL LP injection. In contrast, a 5X increase in bolus rate (25 mL/min) did not improve tracer exposure to the brain. An increase in cardiac and respiratory CSF movement improved tracer spread to the brain, basal cistern, and cerebellum up to {\textasciitilde} 2 logs compared to the baseline LP injection. CONCLUSION: The computational modeling approach provides ability to conduct in silico trials representative of CSF injection protocols. Taken together, the findings indicate a strong potential for delivery protocols to be optimized to reach a target region(s) of the spine and/or brain with a needed therapeutic dose. Parametric modification of bolus rate/volume and flush volume was found to have impact on tracer distribution; albeit to a smaller degree than injection location, with CM and ICV injections resulting in greater therapeutic dose to brain regions compared to LP. CSF stroke volume and frequency both played an important role and may potentially have a greater impact than the modest changes in LP injection protocols analyzed such as bolus rate, volume, and flush.},

The present study sets out to establish guidelines for the usage of a three-dimensional steady state porous cerebral perfusion model of the human brain following principles detailed in the verification and validation (V\&V 40) standard of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The model relies on the finite element method and has been developed specifically to estimate how brain perfusion is altered in ischaemic stroke patients before, during, and after treatments. Simulations are compared with exact analytical solutions and a thorough sensitivity analysis is presented covering every numerical and physiological model parameter. The results suggest that such porous models can approximate blood pressure and perfusion distributions reliably even on a coarse grid with first order elements. On the other hand, higher order elements are essential to mitigate errors in volumetric blood flow rate estimation through cortical surface regions. Matching the volumetric flow rate corresponding to major cerebral arteries is identified as a validation milestone. It is found that inlet velocity boundary conditions are hard to obtain and that constant pressure inlet boundary conditions are feasible alternatives. A one-dimensional model is presented which can serve as a computationally inexpensive replacement of the three-dimensional brain model to ease parameter optimisation, sensitivity analyses and uncertainty quantification. The findings of the present study can be generalised to organ-scale porous perfusion models. The results increase the applicability of computational tools regarding treatment development for stroke and other cerebrovascular conditions.},

  abstract = {The advancement of ischaemic stroke treatment relies on resource-intensive experiments and clinical trials. In order to improve ischaemic stroke treatments, such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy, we target the development of computational tools for in silico trials which can partially replace these animal and human experiments with fast simulations. This study proposes a model that will serve as part of a predictive unit within an in silico clinical trial estimating patient outcome as a function of treatment. In particular, the present work aims at the development and evaluation of an organ-scale microcirculation model of the human brain for perfusion prediction. The model relies on a three-compartment porous continuum approach. Firstly, a fast and robust method is established to compute the anisotropic permeability tensors representing arterioles and venules. Secondly, vessel encoded arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging and clustering are employed to create an anatomically accurate mapping between the microcirculation and large arteries by identifying superficial perfusion territories. Thirdly, the parameter space of the problem is reduced by analysing the governing equations and experimental data. Fourthly, a parameter optimization is conducted. Finally, simulations are performed with the tuned model to obtain perfusion maps corresponding to an open and an occluded (ischaemic stroke) scenario. The perfusion map in the occluded vessel scenario shows promising qualitative agreement with computed tomography images of a patient with ischaemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion. The results highlight that in the case of vessel occlusion (i) identifying perfusion territories is essential to capture the location and extent of underperfused regions and (ii) anisotropic permeability tensors are required to give quantitatively realistic estimation of perfusion change. In the future, the model will be thoroughly validated against experiments.},

  abstract   = {The modern pharmaceutical industry is creating a transition from traditional methods to advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. In the current scenario, continuous efforts are being made to incorporate computational modelling and simulation in drug discovery, development, design, and optimization. With the advancement in technology and modernization, many pharmaceutical companies are approaching in silico trials to develop safe and efficacious medicinal products. To obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product from the concerned National regulatory Authority, manufacturers must provide evidence for the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical products in the form of in vitro or in vivo methods. However, more recently this evidence was provided to regulatory agencies in the form of modelling and simulation, i.e., in silico evidence. Such evidence (computational or experimental) will only be accepted by the regulatory authorities if it considered as qualified by them and this will require the assessment of the overall credibility of the method. One must consider the scrutiny provided by the regulatory authority to develop or use the new in silico evidence. The United States Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency are the two regulatory agencies in the world that accept and encourage the use of modelling and simulation within the regulatory process. More efforts must be made by other regulatory agencies worldwide to incorporate such new evidence, i.e., modelling and simulation (in silico) within the regulatory process. This review article focuses on the approaches of in silico trials, its verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification involved in the regulatory evaluation of biomedical products that utilize predictive models.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunotherapies, driven by immune-mediated antitumorigenicity, offer the potential for significant improvements to the treatment of multiple cancer types. Identifying therapeutic strategies that bolster antitumor immunity while limiting immune suppression is critical to selecting treatment combinations and schedules that offer durable therapeutic benefits. Combination oncolytic virus (OV) therapy, wherein complementary OVs are administered in succession, offer such promise, yet their translation from preclinical studies to clinical implementation is a major challenge. Overcoming this obstacle requires answering fundamental questions about how to effectively design and tailor schedules to provide the most benefit to patients. METHODS: We developed a computational biology model of combined oncolytic vaccinia (an enhancer virus) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) calibrated to and validated against multiple data sources. We then optimized protocols in a cohort of heterogeneous virtual individuals by leveraging this model and our previously established in silico clinical trial platform. RESULTS: Enhancer multiplicity was shown to have little to no impact on the average response to therapy. However, the duration of the VSV injection lag was found to be determinant for survival outcomes. Importantly, through treatment individualization, we found that optimal combination schedules are closely linked to tumor aggressivity. We predicted that patients with aggressively growing tumors required a single enhancer followed by a VSV injection 1 day later, whereas a small subset of patients with the slowest growing tumors needed multiple enhancers followed by a longer VSV delay of 15 days, suggesting that intrinsic tumor growth rates could inform the segregation of patients into clinical trials and ultimately determine patient survival. These results were validated in entirely new cohorts of virtual individuals with aggressive or non-aggressive subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, improved therapeutic schedules for combinations with enhancer OVs can be studied and implemented. Our results further underline the impact of interdisciplinary approaches to preclinical planning and the importance of computational approaches to drug discovery and development.},

  abstract  = {Evaluation of medical devices via clinical trial is often a necessary step in the process of bringing a new product to market. In recent years, device manufacturers are increasingly using stochastic engineering models during the product development process. These models have the capability to simulate virtual patient outcomes. This article presents a novel method based on the power prior for augmenting a clinical trial using virtual patient data. To properly inform clinical evaluation, the virtual patient model must simulate the clinical outcome of interest, incorporating patient variability, as well as the uncertainty in the engineering model and in its input parameters. The number of virtual patients is controlled by a discount function which uses the similarity between modeled and observed data. This method is illustrated by a case study of cardiac lead fracture. Different discount functions are used to cover a wide range of scenarios in which the type I error rates and power vary for the same number of enrolled patients. Incorporation of engineering models as prior knowledge in a Bayesian clinical trial design can provide benefits of decreased sample size and trial length while still controlling type I error rate and power.},

In this work, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks to produce synthetic radiological images to be used in in silico trials. The generative models produced credible synthetic sagittal X-rays of the lumbar spine based on a simple sketch, and were able to generate sagittal radiological images of the trunk using coronal projections as inputs, and vice versa. Although numerous inaccuracies in the anatomical details may still allow distinguishing synthetic and real images in the majority of cases, the present work showed that generative models are a feasible solution for creating synthetic imaging data to be used in in silico trials of novel medical devices.},

This study demonstrates a computational framework to systematically evaluate preclinical trial design of target population, pharmacogenetic algorithms, and dosing protocols to optimize primary outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We programmatically created an end-to-end framework that systematically evaluates warfarin clinical trial designs. The framework includes options to create a patient population, multiple dosing strategies including genetic-based and nongenetic clinical-based, multiple-dose adjustment protocols, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics modeling and international normalization ratio prediction, and various types of outcome measures. We validated the framework by conducting 1000 simulations of the applying pharmacogenetic algorithms to individualize dosing of warfarin (CoumaGen) clinical trial primary end points. The simulation predicted a mean time in therapeutic range of 70.6\% and 72.2\% (P=0.47) in the standard and pharmacogenetic arms, respectively. Then, we evaluated another dosing protocol under the same original conditions and found a significant difference in the time in therapeutic range between the pharmacogenetic and standard arm (78.8\% versus 73.8\%; P=0.0065), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that this simulation framework is useful in the preclinical assessment phase to study and evaluate design options and provide evidence to optimize the clinical trial for patient efficacy and reduced risk.},

  abstract   = {Several models have been proposed to describe the glucose system at whole-body, organ/tissue and cellular level, designed to measure non-accessible parameters (minimal models), to simulate system behavior and run in silico clinical trials (maximal models). Here, we will review the authors' work, by putting it into a concise historical background. We will discuss first the parametric portrait provided by the oral minimal models-building on the classical intravenous glucose tolerance test minimal models-to measure otherwise non-accessible key parameters like insulin sensitivity and beta-cell responsivity from a physiological oral test, the mixed meal or the oral glucose tolerance tests, and what can be gained by adding a tracer to the oral glucose dose. These models were used in various pathophysiological studies, which we will briefly review. A deeper understanding of insulin sensitivity can be gained by measuring insulin action in the skeletal muscle. This requires the use of isotopic tracers: both the classical multiple-tracer dilution and the positron emission tomography techniques are discussed, which quantitate the effect of insulin on the individual steps of glucose metabolism, that is, bidirectional transport plasma-interstitium, and phosphorylation. Finally, we will present a cellular model of insulin secretion that, using a multiscale modeling approach, highlights the relations between minimal model indices and subcellular secretory events. In terms of maximal models, we will move from a parametric to a flux portrait of the system by discussing the triple tracer meal protocol implemented with the tracer-to-tracee clamp technique. This allows to arrive at quasi-model independent measurement of glucose rate of appearance (Ra), endogenous glucose production (EGP), and glucose rate of disappearance (Rd). Both the fast absorbing simple carbs and the slow absorbing complex carbs are discussed. This rich data base has allowed us to build the UVA/Padova Type 1 diabetes and the Padova Type 2 diabetes large scale simulators. In particular, the UVA/Padova Type 1 simulator proved to be a very useful tool to safely and effectively test in silico closed-loop control algorithms for an artificial pancreas (AP). This was the first and unique simulator of the glucose system accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a substitute to animal trials for in silico testing AP algorithms. Recent uses of the simulator have looked at glucose sensors for non-adjunctive use and new insulin molecules.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In type 1 diabetes (T1D) research, in-silico clinical trials (ISCTs) notably facilitate the design/testing of new therapies. Published simulation tools embed mathematical models of blood glucose (BG) and insulin dynamics, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors, and insulin treatments, but lack a realistic description of some aspects of patient lifestyle impacting on glucose control. Specifically, to effectively simulate insulin correction boluses, required to treat post-meal hyperglycemia (BG {\textgreater} 180 mg/dL), the timing of the bolus may be influenced by subjects' behavioral attitudes. In this work, we develop an easily interpretable model of the variability of correction bolus timing observed in real data, and embed it into a popular simulation tool for ISCTs. METHODS: Using data collected in 196 adults with T1D monitored in free-living conditions, we trained a decision tree (DT) model to classify whether a correction bolus is injected in a future time window, based on predictors collected back in time, related to CGM data, previous insulin boluses and subject's characteristics. The performance was compared to that of a logistic regression classifier with LASSO regularization (LC), trained on the same dataset. After validation, the DT was embedded within a popular T1D simulation tool and an ISCT was performed to compare the simulated correction boluses against those observed in a subset of data not used for model training. RESULTS: The DT provided better classification performance (accuracy: 0.792, sensitivity: 0.430, specificity: 0.878, precision: 0.455) than the LC and presented good interpretability. The most predictive features were related to CGM (and its temporal variations), time since the last insulin bolus, and time of the day. The correction boluses simulated by the DT, after implementation in the simulation tool, showed a good agreement with real-world data. CONCLUSIONS: The DT developed in this work represents a simple set of rules to mimic the same timing of correction boluses observed on real data. The inclusion of the model in simulation tools allows investigators to perform ISCTs that more realistically represent the patient behavior in taking correction boluses and the post-prandial BG response. In the future, more complex models can be investigated.},

To address trial design with such uncertainty, we developed an epidemiological model of respiratory tract infection (RTI) coupled to a mechanistic description of viral RTI episodes. We explored the impact of reduced viral transmission (mimicking NPIs) using a virtual population and in silico trials for the bacterial lysate OM-85 as prophylaxis for RTI. Ratio-based efficacy metrics are only impacted under strict lockdown whereas absolute benefit already is with intermediate NPIs (eg. mask-wearing). Consequently, despite NPI, trials may meet their relative efficacy endpoints (provided recruitment hurdles can be overcome) but are difficult to assess with respect to clinical relevance. These results advocate to report a variety of metrics for benefit assessment, to use adaptive trial design and adapted statistical analyses. They also question eligibility criteria misaligned with the actual disease burden.},

In this work, we evaluate, in silico, the DIY APS Loop control algorithm and compare it head-to-head with the bio-inspired artificial pancreas (BiAP) controller for which clinical data are available. METHODS: The Python version of the Loop control algorithm called PyLoopKit was employed for evaluation purposes. A Python-MATLAB interface was created to integrate PyLoopKit with the UVa-Padova simulator. Two configurations of BiAP (non-adaptive and adaptive) were evaluated. In addition, the Tandem Basal-IQ predictive low-glucose suspend was used as a baseline algorithm. Two scenarios with different levels of variability were used to challenge the algorithms on the adult (n = 10) and adolescent (n = 10) virtual cohorts of the simulator. RESULTS: Both BiAP and Loop improve, or maintain, glycemic control when compared with Basal-IQ. Under the scenario with lower variability, BiAP and Loop perform relatively similarly. However, BiAP, and in particular its adaptive configuration, outperformed Loop in the scenario with higher variability by increasing the percentage time in glucose target range 70-180 mg/dL (BiAP-Adaptive vs Loop vs Basal-IQ) (adults: 89.9\% ± 3.2\%* vs 79.5\% ± 5.3\%* vs 67.9\% ± 8.3\%; adolescents: 74.6 ± 9.5\%* vs 53.0\% ± 7.7\% vs 55.4\% ± 12.0\%, where * indicates the significance of P {\textless} .05 calculated in sequential order) while maintaining the percentage time below range (adults: 0.89\% ± 0.37\% vs 1.72\% ± 1.26\% vs 3.41 ± 1.92\%; adolescents: 2.87\% ± 2.77\% vs 4.90\% ± 1.92\% vs 4.17\% ± 2.74\%). CONCLUSIONS: Both Loop and BiAP algorithms are safe and improve glycemic control when compared, in silico, with Basal-IQ. However, BiAP appears significantly more robust to real-world challenges by outperforming Loop and Basal-IQ in the more challenging scenario.},

When dealing with a coronary stenting procedure, the virtual scenario should be able to replicate the real device, passing through the different stages of the procedure, which has to maintain the atherosclerotic vessel opened. Nevertheless, most of the published studies adopted commercially resembling geometries and generic material parameters, without a specific validation of the employed numerical models. In this work, a workflow for the generation and validation of the computational model of a coronary stent was proposed. Possible sources of variability in the results, such as the inter-batches variability in the material properties and the choice of proper simulation strategies, were accounted for and discussed. Then, a group of in vitro tests, representative of the device intended use was used as a comparator to validate the model. The free expansion simulation, which is the most used simulation in the literature, was shown to be only partially useful for stent model validation purposes. On the other hand, the choice of proper additional experiments, as the suggested uniaxial tensile tests on the stent and deployment tests into a deformable tube, could provide further suitable information to prove the efficacy of the numerical approach.},

In this study, patient specific finite element (FE) models were used to assess changes in primary stability due to variability in patient anatomy, bone properties and stem alignment for two commonly used cementless femoral stems, Corail® and Summit® (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, USA). Computed-tomography images of the femur were obtained for 8 males and 8 females. An automated algorithm was used to determine the stem position and size which minimized the endo-cortical space, and then span the plausible surgical envelope of implant positions constrained by the endo-cortical boundary. A total of 1952 models were generated and ran, each with a unique alignment scenario. Peak hip contact and muscle forces for stair climbing were scaled to the donor’s body weight and applied to the model. The primary stability was assessed by comparing the implant micromotion and peri-prosthetic strains to thresholds (150 μm and 7000 µε, respectively) above which fibrous tissue differentiation and bone damage are expected to prevail. Despite the wide range of implant positions included, FE prediction were mostly below the thresholds (medians: Corail®: 20–74 µm and 1150–2884 µε, Summit®: 25–111 µm and 860–3010 µε), but sensitivity of micromotion and interfacial strains varied across femora, with the majority being sensitive (p {\textless} 0.0029) to average bone mineral density, cranio-caudal angle, post-implantation anteversion angle and lateral offset of the femur. The results confirm the relationship between implant position and primary stability was highly dependent on the patient and the stem design used.},
